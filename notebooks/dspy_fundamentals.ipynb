He is credited with inventing a military cannon that Isaac Newton described as \"being destructive to the human species\". Copies and details of the model no longer exist. Gregory\\'s use of a barometer to predict farming-related weather conditions led him to be accused of witchcraft by Presbyterian ministers from Aberdeen, although he was never convicted.', 'Gregory Tarchaneiotes | Gregory Tarchaneiotes (Greek: Γρηγόριος Ταρχανειώτης , Italian: \"Gregorio Tracanioto\" or \"Tracamoto\" ) was a \"protospatharius\" and the long-reigning catepan of Italy from 998 to 1006. In December 999, and again on February 2, 1002, he reinstituted and confirmed the possessions of the abbey and monks of Monte Cassino in Ascoli. In 1004, he fortified and expanded the castle of Dragonara on the Fortore. He gave it three circular towers and one square one. He also strengthened Lucera.', 'David Gregory (mathematician) | David Gregory (originally spelt Gregorie) FRS (? 1659 – 10 October 1708) was a Scottish mathematician and astronomer.
